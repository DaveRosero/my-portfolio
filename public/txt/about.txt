Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer with a strong foundation in developing web-based systems and a passion for solving problems through code. I have solid analytical skills and a good understanding of system design. While I specialize in backend development, I also have experience with full-stack workflows. I primarily use PHP as my main programming language and am eager to apply my skills in a dynamic and collaborative environment.
